Tour dates page: The tour dates page could list the band's upcoming shows, including dates, venues, and ticket information. You could also include links to buy tickets or to RSVP on social media.

Music page: The music page could feature a playlist of the band's songs, with options to stream or purchase their music. You could also include lyrics, album artwork, and behind-the-scenes stories about the making of the music.

Videos page: The videos page could include music videos, live performances, and behind-the-scenes footage. You could also include interviews with the band members and other videos related to their music and style.

Merchandise page: The merchandise page could feature the band's branded products, such as T-shirts, hats, and posters. You could include photos of the merchandise, as well as pricing and ordering information.

Contact page: The contact page could include a contact form, as well as the band's email address, social media links, and other ways to get in touch. You could also include a map showing the band's location and links to directions.
